### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-match-platform.git
   cd job-match-platform
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3002
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/job-match-platform
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_change_this_in_production
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the backend server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal window/tab

2. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api
   ```
   
   For production, use:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://ai-powered-job-match-platform-chi.vercel.app/api
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Vite (typically http://localhost:5173)

### Seeding Jobs Data

To seed the database with sample job listings, make a POST request to:
```
POST http://localhost:3002/api/jobs/seed
```

You can do this using Postman or any API testing tool, or by visiting the jobs page in the application which will automatically seed jobs if none exist.

## Getting Your Cohere API Key

1. Visit [Cohere's website](https://cohere.ai/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Navigate to the API section in your dashboard
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key and add it to your `.env` file

The free tier provides sufficient quota for testing and development purposes.

## AI Integration and Prompt Design

The job recommendation system uses the Cohere API to analyze the user's profile and match it with available job listings. Here's how it works:

1. **Data Collection**: When a user clicks "Find My Matches", the system collects:
   - User profile data (skills, experience, location, job preferences)
   - Available job listings

2. **AI Prompt Construction**: The system constructs a prompt for the AI that includes:
   - A clear task description for the AI
   - Structured user profile data
   - Structured job listings data 
   - A specific request for the output format (JSON with job IDs, match scores, and match reasons)

3. **Cohere API Call**: The backend sends this prompt to the Cohere API using the 'command' model, which is a powerful text generation model that can understand and follow complex instructions.

4. **Response Processing**: The AI returns a text response with job recommendations, which is then:
   - Parsed to extract the JSON format with matched jobs
   - Enriched with the full job details from the database
   - Returned to the frontend for display

5. **Fallback Mechanism**: If the AI response parsing fails, a built-in algorithm matches jobs based on skills and job type preferences to ensure users always get recommendations.

### Prompt Design

The prompt is designed to:
- Give the AI a clear role and task
- Provide structured data in a way the AI can analyze
- Request specific output format for easy parsing
- Set parameters to control the AI's creativity and focus

```javascript
const prompt = `You are an AI job matcher. Find the top 3 job matches for this candidate based on their profile and the available job listings.
                
Candidate Profile:
- Name: ${profile.name}
- Location: ${profile.location}
- Years of Experience: ${profile.yearsOfExperience}
- Skills: ${profile.skills.join(', ')}
- Preferred Job Type: ${profile.preferredJobType}

Available Jobs:
${JSON.stringify(jobsData)}

Return ONLY a JSON array of the top 3 job matches with this format:
[
  {
    "id": "job_id",
    "title": "job_title",
    "company": "company_name",
    "matchScore": 85,
    "matchReasons": ["reason1", "reason2", "reason3"]
  },
  ...
]

The matchScore should be between 0-100 and represent how well the candidate matches the job requirements.
The matchReasons should include 2-3 specific reasons why this job is a good match for the candidate.
Return ONLY the JSON array with no additional text.`;
```

### Cohere Integration

The implementation uses Cohere's API, which provides:

1. Strong text generation capabilities
2. Good understanding of structured data
3. Affordable pricing with a free tier
4. Reliable API availability

The API call includes parameters to control the generation:

```javascript
const response = await axios.post(
  'https://api.cohere.ai/v1/generate',
  {
    model: 'command',
    prompt: prompt,
    max_tokens: 1024,
    temperature: 0.3,
    stop_sequences: [],
    return_likelihoods: 'NONE'
  },
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.COHERE_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);
```

### Robust Error Handling

The system includes multiple fallback mechanisms to ensure users always get recommendations:

1. **Primary AI Recommendation**: Uses Cohere API to get intelligent, contextual job matches
2. **First Fallback**: If the AI fails, uses a skill-matching algorithm with weighted scoring
3. **Final Fallback**: If all else fails, uses a simple skill-matching algorithm

This ensures a smooth user experience even if there are issues with the AI response.

## Usage Guide

### For Users

1. **Registration**: Visit the live demo and create an account
2. **Profile Creation**: Complete your professional profile with skills and preferences
3. **Browse Jobs**: Explore available job listings with search and filtering
4. **Get Recommendations**: Click "Find My Matches" to get AI-powered job recommendations
5. **Apply**: View job details and apply to positions that interest you

### For Developers

1. **Testing the API**: Use the live backend URL with tools like Postman
2. **Local Development**: Follow the setup instructions above
3. **Customization**: Modify the AI prompt in `recommendationController.js` for different matching logic
4. **Adding Features**: Extend the models and controllers for additional functionality

## Trade-offs and Assumptions

1. **Authentication**: Implemented a simple JWT-based authentication system. In a production environment, you might want to add features like email verification, password reset, and refresh tokens.

2. **Job Data**: The application uses a seeded dataset of jobs. In a real-world scenario, this would be connected to a job board API or have an admin interface for job management.

3. **AI Integration**: The system uses a simple but effective prompt to get job recommendations. More advanced implementations could include:
   - Fine-tuned models for job matching
   - More sophisticated scoring algorithms
   - Learning from user feedback on recommendations

4. **Performance**: The current implementation fetches all jobs for the AI to analyze. With a large job database, you would need pagination and pre-filtering based on key parameters.

5. **Security**: Basic security measures are implemented, but a production system would need additional hardening, rate limiting, and perhaps HTTPS-only cookies.

6. **Styling Framework**: Used Bootstrap instead of Tailwind CSS for faster development and better component library support.
